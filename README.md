# Xenon Scattering Analysis

This project contains Python scripts for analyzing laser scattering signals in Xenon experiments.

## Features
- Compute RMS from PicoScope voltage data
- Interpolate temperature data from LabJack
- Generate T vs RMS, RMS vs Time plots

## Structure
- `scripts/` – all analysis code
- `data/` – (excluded) raw PicoScope & temperature files
- `output/` – (excluded) plots and CSV results
